1. 

A <m HALTtm : Language A is mapping reducable to language B, if there exists a computable function 
2. Show that A is Turing-recognizable iff A <m HALTtm
	A language is Turing-recognizable if some turing machine recognizes it
	ie a TM will enumerate all valid strings of a language.
	a. A is Turing recognizable if A <m HALTtm.
		If A is Turing recognizable, there exists a Turing machine M that recognizes A.
		A = {w | M accepts w}
		Examine: f(w) = <

	b. if A <m HALTtm, A is Turing-recognizable.
		If A<m HALTtm, then HALTtm is Turing-recognizable.
		Because HALTtm is Turing-recognizable, A is Turing-recognizable by Theorem 5.28

	mapping reduction: any instance of decision problem A can be turned into an instance of decision problem B.
		Transform the given A problem instance to a corresponding B problem instance
		Call a solver for B problem instances and return whatever answer (y/n) it gives
